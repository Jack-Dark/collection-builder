          <h2>Why it's Important to track your collections</h2>
          <p>
            The absolute biggest reason is for those worst case scenarios where
            some (or all) of your collection is lost so that you have a complete
            and comprehensive log of everything for insurance. I've seen too
            many examples of folks that spent years building up their collection
            just to suffer a house fire or a break in and suddenly everything is
            gone. If you don't have a full accounting of your collections,
            you're only going to get a fraction of what you're owed by
            insurance.
